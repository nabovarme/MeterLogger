Protocols
.........

I have chosen to document the kamstrup multical 601 protocol since its not available in the public domain and protected
by an NDA so i regard the work done on freeing the protocol as a public service. The MQTT protocol is also
documented more loosely since its freely available.
DNS and ntp are not documented since they not represent major parts of the system and are documented many places.
